That "game" was my first game ever created, so it's shitty. I created it 3 years from now (2017). I think I made big progress since then and that's why I remaked it once again. Hope it looks better. [Click here if you are interested](https://github.com/morsisko/SFML-FlappyBird). I will leave the repo here just for memories. If you ever think about looking at code in this repo don't do it. Just don't. Thanks me later.
